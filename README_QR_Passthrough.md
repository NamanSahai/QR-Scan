# QR Code Passthrough AR with Meta Quest

This is a Unity VR project built for Meta Quest 3 that uses passthrough camera access and QR code detection to place 3D models on real-world surfaces. It combines Meta XR's passthrough tools with ZXing barcode scanning and raycasting to create a simple yet powerful AR interaction.

Once a QR code is scanned using the passthrough feed, the system casts a ray into the real world from the QR center and anchors a virtual object (like a model or cube) on any detected surface. The object stays anchored and can be adjusted manually after its first placement.

---

## Key Features

- Real-time QR detection from passthrough stream
- Object placement using raycast surface hit
- Adjustable object transforms after placement
- Ray + debug visual markers to confirm detection
- TextMeshPro UI logging for in-headset feedback

---

## Requirements

- Unity 2022.3 LTS or Unity 6 (URP)
- Meta Quest 3 (or 2/Pro with passthrough)
- Meta XR All-in-One SDK
- ZXing.Net (for QR code detection)
- Android Build Support enabled in Unity

---

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open it in Unity Hub
3. Switch build target to **Android**
4. Set XR Plugin to **Meta XR**
5. Connect Quest via Link or USB
6. Build and Run the `SampleScene`
7. Scan a QR → the linked object appears on the surface

## Credits

- Built by Naman Sahai  
- Meta XR SDK (All-in-One)  
- ZXing.Net open-source barcode scanner  
- Unity URP 3D Core Template

---

## Notes

- Tested on Meta Quest 3
- Works best with good lighting and clear QR codes
- Once scanned, objects won’t reposition again (unless reset manually)
